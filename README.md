# SPI stands for SERIAL PERIPHERAL INTERFACE CONTROLLER.
# Serial peripheral interface (SPI) is an interface commonly used in computers and embedded systems to facilitate short-distance communication between a microcontroller and one or more  
# peripheral ICs. Multiple transmission lines or signal wires connect the SPI chips, enabling the microcontroller to exchange data with the peripherals.
# Motorola developed the SPI architecture in the 1980s to provide an interface that supports serial, synchronous and full-duplex communications:
# SPI's flexibility, speed, and relatively simple implementation make it a popular choice for various applications, such as connecting sensors, displays, memory devices, and other 
# peripherals to microcontrollers and embedded systems.
