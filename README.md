# SPI stands for SERIAL PERIPHERAL INTERFACE CONTROLLER.
Serial peripheral interface (SPI) is an interface commonly used in computers and embedded systems to facilitate short-distance communication between a microcontroller and one or more  
peripheral ICs. Multiple transmission lines or signal wires connect the SPI chips, enabling the microcontroller to exchange data with the peripherals.
Motorola developed the SPI architecture in the 1980s to provide an interface that supports serial, synchronous and full-duplex communications:
SPI's flexibility, speed, and relatively simple implementation make it a popular choice for various applications, such as connecting sensors, displays, memory devices, and other 
peripherals to microcontrollers and embedded systems.
# The primary objectives of this project are:-
High-Speed Data Transfer: Create an SPI Controller capable of achieving high-speed data transfer rates while adhering to timing constraints. Consider strategies to optimize clock synchronization and data transmission efficiency.

Flexible Device Interfacing: Develop the controller to support interfacing with various types of peripheral devices, such as sensors, memory modules, and displays. Implement individual chip select lines to enable selective communication with multiple slaves. 

Reliable Communication: Implement error-checking mechanisms to ensure reliable data transfer between master and slave devices. Investigate techniques to detect and recover from potential data corruption or transmission errors.
